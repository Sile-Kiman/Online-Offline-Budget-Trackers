Title: Online-Offline-Budget-Trackers

Usage/Description:
This assignement  is to create an app that allows user to  track their expenses whether they are onling of offline. 

How does this work:
1- When user lands on the page, he/she  will see the last transaction if any 
2- User Can   enter a new transaction and save it  while offline. This transaction should be recorded in local indexDB and  then render back to the page after getting pushed to the server Mongo DB.  
3-  User can add or Substract transactions.
